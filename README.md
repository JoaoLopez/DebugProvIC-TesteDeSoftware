DebugProv
==========

DebugProv is an algorithmic debugger designed to locate defects in python programs.  
Through the provenance enhancement technique, DebugProv can remove from the search space sub-computations that did not contribute to the production of an incorrect output, reducing the number of questions in the navigation phase of algorithmic debugging.

Team
----

The main DebugProv team is composed by researchers from Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF) in Brazil.

Quick Installation
------------------

To install DebugProv, you should first set up a Python 3.7 environment.

The requirements for running DebugProv are: noWorkflow 2.0-alpha, graphviz, and prompt-toolkit.
 
To install noWorkflow 2.0-alpha, follow these basic instructions:
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:gems-uff/noworkflow.git
$ cd noworkflow
$ git checkout 2.0-alpha
$ cd capture
$ python setup.py install
```
This installs noWorkflow 2.0-alpha.

To install the other dependencies, please do:
```bash
$ pip install graphviz
$ pip install prompt-toolkit
```

Basic Usage
-----------

To start an algorithmic debugging session of a defective Python program, you should run:
```bash
$ debugprov program.py
```

To pass arguments to the program:
```bash
$ debugprov program.py first_arg second_arg 
```
